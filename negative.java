###Imagine you are part of a software development team at a
tech company, and your manager has assigned you a task
related to financial data analysis. The company's accounting
system has just reported four key financial metrics for a
project, denoted as a b c and d. However, there is a twist:
some of these metrics might be negative indicating a loss.
Your task is to identify and sum up all the negative metrics.
there are no negative values, the system should return O,
ensuring no incorrect financial interpretation. Your solution
will help the finance team quickly assess any losses that need
immediate attention.###

###Objective: Write a program that takes four integers as input and
outputs the(SÃœm of all negative integers. If there are no negative
integers, the output should be 0.###



public class negative {
    public static void sumofneg(int a, int b, int c, int d) {
        int[] nums = { a, b, c, d };
        int sumneg = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < 0) {
                sumneg += num;

            }

        }
        System.out.println(sumneg);

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = -3, b = 7, c = -1, d = 4;
        sumofneg(a, b, c, d);

    }
}
